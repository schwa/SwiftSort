# swiftsort

Be the envy of your co-workers! Sort the top-level elements of your Swift files!

Top-level elements are sorted by "group" (currently ordered by imports, variables (let, var), types (enums, classes, actors, structs), extensions and then functions) and then alphabetically within each type.

## Installation

Hmm. Homebrew or something. Someone help me out here.

## Usage
